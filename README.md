# Height_Weight_prediction
This project can implement weight prediction using several machine learning models:

*   **Linear Regression:** A simple and interpretable model that assumes a linear relationship between height and weight.

*   **Polynomial Regression:** An extension of linear regression that allows for non-linear relationships.

*   **Decision Tree Regression:** A tree-based model that makes predictions by recursively partitioning the feature space.

*   **Random Forest Regression:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees.

*   **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression:** Predicts weight based on the average weight of the k-nearest data points.

*   **Support Vector Regression (SVR):**  Effective in high-dimensional spaces, but can be computationally intensive.

*   **Other Models:** You could also include other models like Gradient Boosting Regression (XGBoost, LightGBM), Neural Networks, etc.

For each method, briefly explain its principles and any specific parameters used.
